<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>I've been a biohacker ever since I discovered self-hypnosis
in high school. I had just moved in with my Dad after my
parents had a bad divorce and my self esteem was really
messed up.  I began reading books on self-hypnosis and
making my own cassette tapes to reprogram my mind.</p>

<p>Self-hypnosis had worked so well I was able to transition
into a new school district with ease. Where I had been
struggling at my previous school due to all the conflicts at
home I was able to rewrite my own code and become a new
person. I was able to choose who that person was.  I became
a self programming machine.</p>

<p><iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fystyFdliPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe></p>

<p>Since then I've actively sought out and tested every bio
hacking technique I could get my hands on.  This is a
compilation of almost 2 decades of my personal experiments
and these are some of the techniques that I'm either working
on now or that I've come back to over and over again through
the years.</p>

<h2>Breathing Exercises</h2>

<p>Breathing is the core of our survival.  Our bodies handle
this for us automatically. We breathe even when we don't
think about it.  Just because it's on autopilot doesn't mean
there's no value to consciously controlling your breathing,
on the contrary, the maker of this game imbued us with
sophisticated mental cheat codes using a variety of rhythmic
breath patterns.</p>

<img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/breathing.jpg">

<p>There is an ancient practice of Yogic breathing called
Pranayama from which many of these breathing patterns are
derived. Being a drummer the value in these rhythms made sense
to me fairly quickly and inspired me to do more research.</p>

<h4>I'll simplify it down to the component parts.</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Inhale</strong> - Full belly breathing, stick your gut out to help get a full inhalation
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Retain</strong> - Hold your lungs full of oxygen
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exhale</strong> - Release the air from your lungs
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sustain</strong> - Hold your lungs empty without air
  </li>
</ol>

<img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/bellybreathing.png">

<p>A sample pattern might be 4:7:8 - 4 counts inhale, 7 counts
retain, 8 counts exhale. Notice how this pattern has no
sustain.  That's because that produces a different effect.</p>

<h4>More components:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Full Nose Breathing</li>
  <li>Left Nostril only </li>
  <li>Right Nostril only</li>
  <li>Mouth Breathing</li>
</ol>

<h3>Roger Cole PhD<br />Neurophysiological Foundations of Yoga Breathing</h3>

<p><iframe class="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CtPXzhOQsco" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>Chant or Singing on Exhale</h3>

<p>Various mouth positions during vowels and consonants
localize the vibration of the chosen pitch.  For example a
H-mmmmm sound would produce a vibration in the roof of your
mouth, vibrating your brain at that frequency.</p>

<p>Since your brain functions at a frequency applying frequencies to your brain can alter your state of consciousness. The sound OM is very resonant amplifying the vibrations across your body.</p>

<img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/om.jpg">

<h3>Breathing? There's an APP for that!</h3>

<p>I recommend an Android app called <a href="http://pranabreath.info/" target="_blank">Prana Breath</a>. If you have
IOS  just install an Android emulator like <a href="http://www.bluestacks.com/" target="_blank">Bluestacks</a> or
<a href="http://www.memuplay.com/" target="_blank">Memu</a> on your computer and load it there.  You have to go pro
to get the more sophisticated exercises. I've been using it
to experiment with my own custom breathing patterns
specifically for coding <strong>and am interested in building my own
app that provides these custom patterns specifically for coders</strong>.</p>

<img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/prana_breath.jpg">

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiT2-6B--LSAhWCz4MKHYnoCmkQtwIIJDAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPSdwU6fIr_A&usg=AFQjCNE6_wTaiOxTSuqPHu88Vina_MlWcw&sig2=Hz9fD25BMlPmbi8nhhjoyA" target="_blank">As a drummer</a> being able to do multiple things at a time or
"independence" has been a feature of my life.  It occurred
to me that I could train myself to breathe in these patterns
and my muscle memory would allow me to begin to do them
unconsciously while I work as long as I have the breathing
metronome to follow.</p>

<img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/neuromorphic_engineering.jpg">

<h3>A few altered states a programmer might want to use</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Meditative Trance for coding (The Zone) </li>
  <li>Calm frustrated or hyperactive feelings (Fidgeting)</li>
  <li>Synchronize brain hemispheres to reduce brain fog (ADHD)</li>
  <li>Mental and Physical Energy Boost (Tired)</li>
  <li>Increase Clarity (Detoxification of Neurotoxins)</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to note that if you try these exercises make sure
that you are controlling your breath so that a 7 second
inhale is 7 seconds of inhaling. The speed at which the air
enters and leaves your lungs is very important in creating
the mental effects.</p>

<h3>Other altered states reachable by breathing</h3>

<p>Then you have other possible altered states that don't
really do much for coding like the ability to make your
entire body feel a euphoric buzzing or even a
feeling of being high. Helpful to mention because from a
"Spiritual" perspective these altered states are also the
key to revealing the nature of reality to yourself.

Stanislav Grof a leading LSD researcher in the 70's began
researching a process called holographic breathing which he
claims can release natural DMT (a psychedelic) in your
brain.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCzG9QsM-Pw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

It's easy to dismiss insights learned from drug induced
altered states of consciousness as not real, but it's very
difficult to dismiss insights gained completely sober just
by breathing air in rhythmic patterns.</p>

<h3>Why not use it all the time?</h3>

<p>Unless you're talking to someone while
coding, there's nothing stopping you from breathing in these
ways the entire time you are programming, getting the
benefits the entire time. I'll bet you all $5 that once we
begin to merge with computers we'll be able to load these
breathing patterns to fire off unconsciously at will.</p>

<h3>Brainwave Entrainment</h3>

<p>Brainwave entrainment, or 'neural entrainment', refers to
the capacity of the brain to naturally synchronize its
brainwave frequencies with the rhythm of periodic external
stimuli, most commonly auditory, visual, or tactile.</p>
<p>Brainwave entrainment technologies are used to induce
various brain states, such as relaxation or sleep, by
creating stimuli that occur at regular, periodic intervals
to mimic electrical cycles of the brain during the desired
states, thereby "training" the brain to consciously alter
states.</p>

<img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/evoked_entrainment.jpg">

<img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/brainwave_entrainment.gif">

<p>Recurrent acoustic frequencies, flickering lights,
or tactile vibrations are the most common examples of
stimuli applied to generate different sensory responses.</p>
<p>Our brains function at a variety of frequencies that are
too slow for the human ear to pick up.  In order to effect
your brain frequencies you can listen to binaural beats.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/brain-waves.jpg"></p>

<h4>Binaural Beats</h4>

<p>Human subjects rarely hear frequencies below 20 Hz, which
is exactly the range of Delta, Theta, Alpha, and low to
mid Beta brainwaves. Among the methods by which some
investigations have sought to overcome this problem is to
measure electroencephalogram (EEG) readings of a subject
while he or she listens to binaural beats.</p>

<p>A binaural beat is an auditory illusion perceived when two
different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies
lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference
between them, are presented to a listener dichotically,
that is one through each ear.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/brain_wave_states.jpg"></p>

<p>For example, if a 530 Hz pure tone is presented to a
subject's right ear, while a 520 Hz pure tone is presented
to the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the
auditory illusion of a third tone, in addition to the two
pure-tones presented to each ear.</p>

<p>The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this
example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a
frequency of 10 Hz, that being the difference between the
530 Hz and 520 Hz pure tones presented to each ear.</p>

<h3>Isochronic Tones</h3>

<p>Isochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone that
are used alongside monaural beats and binaural beats in
the process called brainwave entrainment. At its simplest
level, an isochronic tone is a tone that is being turned
on and off rapidly. They create sharp, distinctive pulses
of sound.</p>

<p>I run the bluestacks android emulator on my macbook to run
Prana Breath breathing exercises, layering the below
YouTube video and many others on top while I'm studying.</p>
<p>I find that the most brutal of brainwave entrainment works
best for myself.  This means intense levels of pink noise,
binaural beats as well as isochronic pulses to help my
brain lock into the meditative state of consciousness.</p>

<h3>Meditation Practice</h3>

<p>My dad and cousin are studying Zen buddhism with teachers
formally so I've come into contact with Zen practice
frequently over the past 7 years.  There's a great Zen
center in Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue and they host a
meditation for beginners session every week. They also host
a introduction to Zen weekend retreat at their monastery in
upstate New York.</p>

<p>I'll simplify.  Meditation is the process of studying one's
own thoughts.  It helps you to generate a meta-level higher
than the part of your consciousness that talks and thinks.
You can use this meta-level to study the way you think as if
outside of yourself.  Being conscious of your consciousness
unlocks the ability to make changes to it and to control it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/meditation_technology.jpg"></p>

<p>In Zen the practice of meditation is called "Sitting." At my
best I'm able to get 15-30 minutes a day in.  I was taught
to count my breath and focus on the the breath itself. As
soon as I caught myself in mind chatter I would acknowledge
that my mind is chattering bring the count back to 1 and
start over again.  This is why it's called practice. It's a
mental skill that must be practiced in order to make it
stronger.  The goal is to go longer and longer without a
mental interruption.</p>

<p>Being able to maintain a state of consciousness with no
intruding thoughts is extremely difficult and frustrating,
but one finds that after a certain period of time during a
meditation session the mind will naturally calm and it
becomes easier.</p>

<p>This empty minded state tends to create a mental environment
where the thoughts that start to actually poke through your
mind shield are the more important ones that were fighting
to get through all the thoughts about who's doing what on
Facebook.  It takes shutting off the internal noise in your
mind to be able to force the most important ideas through.</p>

<h2>Nootropics</h2>

<p>I recently got into biohacking nootropics after discovering
/r/nootropics on reddit. Nootropics—also called smart drugs
or cognitive enhancers—are drugs, supplements, or other
substances that improve cognitive function, particularly
executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in
healthy individuals.</p>

<img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/smartdrugs.jpg">

<p>The use of cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals
in the absence of a medical indication is one of the most
debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and
physicians which spans a number of issues, including the
ethics and fairness of their use, concerns over adverse
effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for
non-medical uses, among others.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded US$1 billion in 2015 and the global demand for
these compounds is still growing rapidly.</p>

<p>These guys on /r/nootropics got super obsessed and tried
everything on there (which is daunting if you click the link below) and
created Nootrobox.</p>

<img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/fullstack.jpg">

<p>My wife bought me the full stack from Nootrobox for my
birthday and I'm blown away by how much it has amped up my
energy level, attention span, memory, and ability process
new concepts.  Week 1 at Flatiron my brain felt like it was
on fire...until maybe Thursday where I had gotten so little
sleep that no nootropic in the world could help my brain.</p>

<p>For those who were freaking out I know exactly how it feels
to try to understand something and nothing comes out but a
feeling of frustration.  This will bump that up a level
where the frustration subsides and you find yourself able to
approach these things calmly with far less brain fog.</p>

<p>They have a daily supplement called Rise and a fish oil blend supplement
called Kado 3 that you take daily. Then you have a bottle of
Sprint which provides 4-6 hours of focus and energy that you take as needed and Yawn a sleep aid you take as needed.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>Week 1 at Flatiron School I found that eating was the
hardest thing for me. I just didn't care or want to eat at
all. Every time we had a break I was way more interested
in talking to my cohort and found myself barely eating
anything. When I wasn't chatting I was obsessively
coding... How could I not? I've been stacking all these
techniques to get in the zone?</p>

<p>I'd power through and find my energy level starting to
fail because of it. Our brains are super complex requiring
a balance of sleep, oxygen, calories, and nutrition. If any
one of those starts to dip more than a few days you're
going to start getting that frustrating tired brain fog.</p>

<h3>Epic Bars</h3>

<p>If you're a meat eater these grass fed beef bars feel so
filling in a pinch. They have lots of protein so they were
made popular by Crossfit people but they work just as well
for us hackers too. They got me out of a breakfastless jam a
few mornings.</p>

<img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/epicbars.jpg">

<h3>Soylent</h3>

<p>My wife just ordered a case of Soylent for me so I'll let you
guys know how it works. It's supposed to be a 400 calorie
total meal replacement using Soy so it's totally
vegetarian friendly.</p>

<h2>Power Napping</h2>

<p>Just like the breathing exercises sometimes the most
important things are staring you right in the face.  I've
been keeping records of my experiments using these
techniques for a while now and one of the areas I focus on
is sleep.</p>

<p>I can see a direct correlation between my mood and the
level of brain fog I have on any given day to the amount
of quality sleep I got the night before.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before Nootrobox provides a supplement
called Yawn which helps boost sleep at night. You can also
get a variety of sleep aids on Amazon which work fairly
well.</p>

<p>If you want to use Prana Breath and Brainwave entrainment
to fall asleep I recommend getting a pair of sleep
headphones. I've tried many of them and so far these have
been the best constructed.</p>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0DMERI/ref=sr_ph_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489934320&sr=sr-1&keywords=sleep+headphones" target="_blank"><img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/sleep_phone_mask.jpg"></a>

<p>I always get wired sleep headphones/sleep mask combo because the bluetooth ones
will run out of battery overnight. Other brands of sleep
headphones have had the cords break from shotty
construction and have designs where the headphones fall
over while you sleep.  These do a great job at solving
those issues.</p>

<h4>On to the napping</h4>

<p>Power napping is the single greatest life hack in
existence. Using brainwave entrainment and hypnotic
suggestion you can train your brain to get as much REM
sleep in 25 minutes as you get in 2 hours of night time
sleep. This means that adding just 1x 25 minute nap per day
is like getting an extra 2 hours of sleep... That's
insane.</p>

<p>When I first discovered this in Tim Ferris' book "
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman-ebook/dp/B003EI2EH2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1489934555&sr=8-1&keywords=4+hour+body"
target="_blank">The 4 Hour Body</a>" I wanted to try every
variation of sleep hacking he described. I had a girlfriend
who got home from work very late, a sales job requiring boundless energy, and an early start time. I had to figure something out.</p>

<img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/4hourbody.jpg">

<p>Sleep cycles last approximately 90 minutes and
if you wake up before a cycle completes you will feel like
crap. If your nap exceeds 25 minutes your brain will begin the
rest of the cycle and you'll feel awful if you don't complete it so always limit the power nap to < 25 minutes.</p>
  <p>My favorite app for this is called
    <a
href="http://pzizz.com/" target="_blank">Pzizz</a> and
I've been using it for years. The power nap feature works
for me every single time. I've been working on custom
Prana Breath breathing patterns to layer on top to aid
falling asleep further.</p>

<img src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/pzizz.jpg">

<p>The book talks about crazy things like taking 2 naps a day
and then sleeping 3 hours at night.  All the way to the
uberman method which consists of 6x 25 minute naps and no
sleep at night.</p>

<p>I tried this while working a web design sales job and
slept in the stairwell with Pzizz during lunch time
until the CEO of our startup offered to let me sleep in
the conference room instead. Energy on the phone is obviously
very important in sales so I was trying everything I could.</p>

<p>Long story short. It totally worked.  The downside is
that the naps have to be spaced 3 hours apart and if you
miss one you will crash really hard... so this is only
really advisable if your schedule is incredibly flexible.
It's totally doable for everyone to add at least 1x nap to
their day though... Since I usually get about 6 hours of
sleep each night this extra for 2 hours of sleep from the
25min nap really makes up the difference.</p>

<img class="center" src="/images/enhanced-concentration-techniques/rem.jpg">

<p>I should also mention that reorganization of memory and
detoxification of brain fog causing neurotoxins happens
during REM sleep, so this instant 20 minutes of REM sleep
trick is pretty ridiculous if you find your brain starting
to completely fail you.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As a composer I had to learn to be creative on command
and I've used all of the above techniques while writing my
music.  Using a combination of all these techniques has
enabled me to be creative instantly and reliably.</p>

<p>No more "Waiting for the Muse."</p>

<p>I'm applying all of this to coding since
there seems to be endless parallels between music and code
and <strong>I encourage you guys to pick out one of these life
hacks and try it on yourself today.</strong></p>
