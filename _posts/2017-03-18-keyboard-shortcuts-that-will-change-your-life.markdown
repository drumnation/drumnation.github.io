## Preface

Keyboard shortcuts are the fastest way to speed up productivity on the computer. This is why VIM fanatics exist. VIM is an IDE that is completely keyboard based. VIM is really hardcore but I did learn a few things from using it. I've compiled a list of all the keyboard shortcut ways in various programs that save me a lot of time.

**You must actively PRACTICE keyboard shortcuts** if you ever want to be able to use them quickly and unconsciously.

**1.** The first thing you should do is make it a game to identify all the moments where you could benefit from using a shortcut you're trying to memorize.

**2.** Once your brain has created synapses for noticing moments where the shortcut could be of use you should make yourself use the shortcut at those moments even if it's clunky or slow.

**3.** If there's ever something you notice to be time consuming or cumbersome that you're doing repetitively, remember to check if there is an atom package or natural keyboard shortcut that could take that weight off your shoulders.

## MacOS shortcuts

I screenshot all the time and the default shortcuts are really cumbersome. I changed them using the guide below to the shortcuts I list below. Give it a try it will change your life!

Here's a [guide on how to change your MacOS](http://digbyshelp.blogspot.com/2011/03/imac-change-keyboard-shortcuts-for.html) screenshot hotkeys.

#### Change them to this

*   **option + z** = screenshot selected region save to clipboard
*   **option + a** = screenshot selected region save to file on desktop

#### If you would prefer to contort your hand into awkward positions these are the default keyboard shortcuts.

*   **command + shift + 3** = take a picture of the whole screen *region is usually more useful
*   **command + shift + 4** = take a picture of selected region of the screen

As you read in my Anki post I take a ton of screenshots building the cards for my deck. These custom shortcuts make screen-shotting so easy it blew up the efficiency in which I could digitally communicate and save my ideas. Also helpful for screen-shotting for blog content.

## ALFRED

I found out about Alfred 3 through the bootcamp prep. If you didn't notice it, I found it to be a shockingly awesome application. It hooks into MacOs's spotlight search feature providing it's own search bar that pops up when you type option + command.

Alfred allows you to install automation scripts from a variety of user generated repos that let you hook Alfred into all kinds of data. I have Alfred able to control my lights, directly search for youtube videos, open Spotify songs, etc...

## Atom Shortcuts

*   **command + shift + d** = Duplicates the selected text. This is fantastic for creating a list item and then duplicating it 10 times as a template then just changing the file url or something.
*   **command + d** = Say I need to delete quotes that are around 15 lines of strings. If I select everything it will delete everything. This is also super helpful if you need change a variable name throughout your entire program. Use this to select each word in your program and then just retype it.
*   **command + i** = This runs your program if you installed the script plugins.
*   **command + shift + enter** = This adds a new line above your cursor instead of below.
*   **command + ]** = (when text is selected) indent entire selection right
*   **command + [** = (when text is selected) indent entire selection left

## Here are the keyboard shortcut symbols explained

Some of those symbols are quite esoteric. If you ever want to be able to make use of a keyboard shortcut guide you'll need to know what all the symbols actually mean. I have to go back and look all the time since half the keys are described with what looks like ancient Martian hieroglyphics.
